Welcome to Mimic's documentation!
=================================

Mimic is an API-compatible mock service for `Openstack Compute`_ and
Rackspace's implementation of `Identity`_ and `Cloud Load Balancers`_. It is
backed by in-memory data structure rather than a potentially expensive
database.

Mimic helps with:

* fast set-up
* instant response
* cost efficient
* enables offline development
* enables ability to test unusual behaviors/errors of an api
* acts as a central repository for mocked responses from services
