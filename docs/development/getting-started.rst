Getting started
===============

Working on ``mimic`` requires the installation of a small number of
development dependencies, which are listed in ``dev-requirements.txt``.
They can be installed in a `virtualenv`_ using `pip`_.
This also installs ``mimic`` in ``editable`` mode.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Create a virtualenv and activate it
    $ pip install --requirement dev-requirements.txt

You are now ready to run the tests and build the documentation.

Some of the `tox`_ jobs may require certain packages to be installed, so
having `homebrew`_ installed would be useful if developing on Mac OS.


Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mimic`` unit tests are found in the ``mimic/test/`` directory.
They are written as `Twisted`_ tests and can be run either with Twisted's
`trial`_ or with ``unittest2``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ trial mimic

Or

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m unittest discover

You can also check test coverage by using the `coverage`_ tool:

.. code-block:: console

    $ coverage run `which trial` mimic

Or

.. code-block:: console

    $ coverage run -m unittest discover


You can also run the tests for other python interpreters.  We use
`tox`_, which creates a `virtualenv`_ per tox job to run tests, linting, etc.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox
    ...
     py26: commands succeeded
     py27: commands succeeded
     pypy: commands succeeded
     docs: commands succeeded
     lint: commands succeeded


Building documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mimic`` documentation is stored in the ``docs/`` directory. It is
written in `reStructured Text`_ and rendered using `Sphinx`_.

To build the documentation, run ``sphinx``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sphinx-build -W -b html -d _tmp/doctrees docs docs/_build/html

The HTML documentation index can now be found at
``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

Alternately, you can use our ``tox`` job:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e docs

Building a Mac application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The officially supported method of building of the application depends on the
system python, `pyobjc`_, and `py2app`_ libraries installed with Mac OS.
`Travis-CI`_ is configured to build the mac application and run its tests.

To build the application and run its tests locally use the following commands.

.. code-block:: console

   $ cd /dir/where/mimic/lives/
   $ ./build-app.sh


Once built, ``mimic.app`` can be found in the ``./dist`` directory.
This application can be treated like any other mac application and moved into
``~/Applications``.
To start ``mimic``, use the open command with the path to ``mimic.app``
, e.g. ``open ./dist/mimic.app``.

When the application is running, the letter ``M`` will be visible in the
menubar. To quit the application, simply click on the ``M`` and select
``Quit``. You can view the application logs by opening
``Applications/Utilities/Console.app``.

To run ``mimic.app``'s tests use

.. code-block:: console

   $ /path/to/mimic.app/Contents/MacOS/run-tests

The application can also built as a standalone application
that does not depend on the system python.
This is *not* the officially supported method of building the application and
is *not* tested by `Travis-CI`_.

To build a standalone application, ``py2app`` requires the installation of a
non-system framework python.
In my experience, it is easiest to install a brewed 2.7 python.
To install a brew python, you'll need to have `homebrew`_ installed.

The following commands will build the standalone application and run its
tests.

.. code-block:: console

   $ brew install python
   $ cd /dir/where/mimic/lives/

   # build a virtualenv using the brewed python
   $ virtualenv -p /usr/local/bin/python2.7 ./venv
   $ source ./venv/bin/activate

   # install mimic's dependencies including pyobjc and py2app
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ pip install -r py2app-requirements.txt
   $ python setup.py py2app
   $ ./dist/mimic.app/Contents/MacOS/run-tests
