Getting started
===============

Working on ``mimic`` requires the installation of a small number of
development dependencies, which are listed in ``dev-requirements.txt``.
They can be installed in a `virtualenv`_ using `pip`_.
This also installs ``mimic`` in ``editable`` mode.

For example:

.. code-block:: console

    $ # Create a virtualenv and activate it
    $ pip install --requirement dev-requirements.txt

You are now ready to run the tests and build the documentation.

Some of the `tox`_ jobs may require certain packages to be installed, so
having `homebrew`_ installed would be useful if developing on Mac OS.


Running tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mimic`` unit tests are found in the ``mimic/test/`` directory.
They are written as `Twisted`_ tests and can be run either with Twisted's
`trial`_ or with ``unittest2``.

.. code-block:: console

    $ trial mimic

Or

.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m unittest discover

You can also check test coverage by using the `coverage`_ tool:

.. code-block:: console

    $ coverage run `which trial` mimic

Or

.. code-block:: console

    $ coverage run -m unittest discover


You can also run the tests for other python interpreters.  We use
`tox`_, which creates a `virtualenv`_ per tox job to run tests, linting, etc.:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox
    ...
     py26: commands succeeded
     py27: commands succeeded
     pypy: commands succeeded
     docs: commands succeeded
     lint: commands succeeded


Building documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``mimic`` documentation is stored in the ``docs/`` directory. It is
written in `reStructured Text`_ and rendered using `Sphinx`_.

To build the documentation, run ``sphinx``:

.. code-block:: console

    $ sphinx-build -W -b html -d _tmp/doctrees docs docs/_build/html

The HTML documentation index can now be found at
``docs/_build/html/index.html``.

Alternately, you can use our ``tox`` job:

.. code-block:: console

    $ tox -e docs
